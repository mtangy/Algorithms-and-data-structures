# Algorithms-and-data-structures-
Various algorithms and data structures made for my Algorithms And Data Structures course written in Python and based of design implementations from the Introduction to Algorithms text book by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein. In order to execute the programs, install the Python interpreter from the Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/). Once installed, open the batch file in the directory of the program you want to run to open Windows Command Prompt in that directory. After the command prompt is open you can execute the desired python file with "python filename.py".
