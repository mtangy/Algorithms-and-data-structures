If Python is installed on your system open batch file and compile .py files with python compiler.

In the school's computers follow the directory path c:/cygwin64/bin/python to open the shell to the compiler. 
From there go to the director containing the python files and type the following commands:

python prims.py
python dijkstra.py


The Python files will compile and the input files in the folder will be read and the output files will be populated
